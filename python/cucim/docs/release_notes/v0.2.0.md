# Version 0.2.0 (December 18, 2020)

## What's new?

The following features are implemented.
- Make it work without CUDA runtime installed
  - CUDA 11.0 runtime is embedded in the .whl file
- Develop a wrapper for cufile API
  - Refer to `Accessing File with GDS` (/notebooks/Accessing_File_with_GDS.html) notebook
  - Did some experiments on accessing TIFF files (see `File-access Experiments on TIFF File` (/notebooks/File-access_Experiments_on_TIFF.html) notebook)
- Support loading [Philips TIFF](https://openslide.org/formats/philips/) files
  - Loading multi-resolution images and associated images (such as 'macro' and 'label') from TIFF Image File Directory (IFD) are available
    - Please see `Basic Usage` (/notebooks/Basic_Usage.html#associated-images) notebook to know how to access the associated images.

    ```{admonition} Characteristic of Philips TIFF format
    As specified in [Philips format](https://openslide.org/formats/philips/),

    "slides may omit pixel data for TIFF tiles not in an ROI; this is represented as a TileOffset of 0 and a TileByteCount of 0. When such tiles are downsampled into a tile that does contain pixel data, their contents are rendered as white pixels."

    For the above reason, some Philips TIFF images can actually hold important information (‘tiles that are not ROIs or tissues’) which can expedite pre-processing by discarding unnecessarily tiles. Due to feature parity with Openslide, cuClaraImage also renders such tiles as white pixels. Please let us know and suggest APIs for getting the information if such non-ROI region information is useful to you.
    ```
  - The following tasks remain for feature-parity with OpenSlide
    - Support Philips TIFF associated image from metadata
    - Expose XML metadata of the Philips TIFF file as JSON
- Provide an example/plan for the interoperability with DALI
  - Created a notebook for the feasibility and plan (see `Working with DALI` (/notebooks/Working_with_DALI.html) notebook)

## Fixes/Improvements

- Fix again for the error that occurs when loading a TIFF image that has `TIFFTAG_JPEGTABLES` tag
  - `ERROR in line 126 while reading JPEG header tables: Not a JPEG file: starts with 0x01 0x00` message can be shown
- Force-reinstall cucim Python package in the Tox environment whenever `gen_docs` or `gen_docs_dev` command is executed
